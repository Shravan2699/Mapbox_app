html js simple app file structure
ChatGPT
A simple HTML/JS app typically consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Here's a basic file structure for such an app:

graphql
Copy code
project-folder/
│
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── style.css           # CSS file for styling
└── script.js           # JavaScript file for functionality
In this structure:

index.html: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of your web page. It references the CSS and JavaScript files.

style.css: This is the CSS file where you define the styles for your HTML elements.

script.js: This is the JavaScript file where you define the functionality of your app.

Your index.html file might look something like this:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Simple App</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Simple App</h1>


    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
